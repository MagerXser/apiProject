## Table of Content

### About the Project

We are creating a basic API system that is able to perform basic functions to the Sakila database that has been provided
to us. We are using different HTTP methods to do things with the data we have in the database. These are GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE and PATCH.

### Getting Started
This will help you get started getting our project on your system.

1. Clone the repository using Git Bash or Console - using git clone with the URL below.

```https://github.com/alexsusanu/apiProject.git```

2. Open your project from within your coding editor (in this case, this is done through Intellij).
